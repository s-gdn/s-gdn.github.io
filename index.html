                            This program uses IMAP protocol, Gmail API and Outlook API to retrieve your inbox from any email provider of your choice, 
                            which can then be viewed in the built in browser. <br /><br />

                            The training section of the program allows you to train the AI to your liking, giving it price lists, contact info, how it should sound, or anything you might want.
                            It uses the selected email as context, as well as your training data to compose a perfect email exactly how you want everytime, in just one click.
                            Of course you can also edit the email yourself, or compose your own. Then, using SMTP protocol, the email is sent to your chosen recipient.<br /><br />

                    <p>
                        I created this project to put my level design abilities to the test. <br /><br />

                        It uses Gaia to create large, procedural, realistic landscapes, which can be very resource intensive if not done right.<br /><br />

                        So I implemented a system which splits up the large terrain into multiple regions. The regions closest to the player camera 
                        are loaded in full resolution, but the regions past a certain distance are created as "imposter" regions, 
                        being at a lower texture and mesh resolution. These regions are updated dynamically as you move around the map, unloading 
                        imposter terrain as you get closer, and replacing it with the higher resolution terrain.<br /><br />

                        Apart from that, I am also using Unity's HDRP water to render the ocean and rivers, with underwater caustic effects for when the 
                        player is underwater.<br /><br />

                        I have also included terrain objects such as trees, rocks, mushrooms, and soon grass, when I can find a texture that doesn't affect performance too much.
                        These objects are placed procedurally depending on terrain biome, height of terrain, and angle of terrain, ensuring objects are placed realistically.
                        All current objects have an LOD system, meaning the further away from the object you are, the smaller resolution the mesh is, once again, 
                        making performance smooth. <br /><br />

                        And finally, we have particle and sound effects. Particle effects include birds in the sky, butterflies in open fields, and airborne spores 
                        in the woodlands. Atmospheric sound effects are dynamic and change depending on the biome you are in.<br /><br />

                        Overall I am happy with my progress on this project, having never made a procedural terrain before, its interesting to see how realistic
                        a terrain can look, even when its generated automatically without me manually placing anything, while also running smoothly at over 60fps.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                    <p>
                        This project was designed to hone my coding skills related to the movement of a player, by attempting to emulate the movement of games made 
                        with the Source Engine, such as Counter Strike and Half Life, which many people say has some of the most fun movement of any games.<br /><br />

                        The Source Engine movement is interesting, as strafing (moving the mouse left of right, along with syncing the a and d keys with said mouse movement) 
                        allows you to gain velocity (speed) in mid air. If you jump as soon as you hit the ground, you can carry this speed into your next jump, allowing you to chain 
                        these jumps, and get to some very high speeds. As well as that, you can "surf" on objects that are at a certain angle, 
                        if you hold the key that would push you towards the object, as you can see in the demonstration video. This also allows you to gain speed.<br /><br />

                        I created a simple test scene to demonstrate this, complete with just a platform, and a surfable object. The first thing on the agenda was to review the Source Engine's 
                        movement code, which luckily, is readily available and open source. Unity's default movement system is nothing like Source Engine's, but its a good base, So I used this 
                        for our start, and modified some values such as friction and movement speed, to emulate Source's base movement more closely.<br /><br />

                        Lastly I had to implement strafing and surfing mechanics, of which I just looked at the Source Engine's code, and copied these functions in Unity context in C#.<br /><br />

                        Please view the demonstration video to see these mechanics in effect.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        This final project was designed for me to mostly enhance my skills with Photoshop, by creating a retro-style game using hand-drawn,
                        low resolution sprite sheets.<br /><br />

                        The premise of the game is simple, you are a wandering spirit trapped in a dream world, where talking to the various NPCs in the game 
                        would take you into their dreams. What you see in the video above, is the starting scene of the game, in where talking to the man playing 
                        the church organ, he tells you about his most vibrant dream, and you are taken into the main world, complete with cities, towns and other areas, 
                        all having other NPCs of which you can ask about their dreams too, which you are then taken into.<br /><br />

                        This game is unfinished, but the skills I have gained via starting this project are still useful.<br /><br />

                        <p>
                            <br /><br />As well as the skills above, I also have sufficient knowledge in security. I know how to decompile and dissect a program
                            to look for vulnerabilities using various tools such as IDA Pro, dnSpy, Cheat engine and various other decompilers.<br /><br />
                            I enjoy reading about and testing various exploits in new technology, like jailbreaking iPhones, spoofing hardware information,
                            emulating RFID and NFC cards, kernel exploits, among many others. I do this to broaden my understanding of what needs to be in place for technology
                            to be secure. 
                            <br /><br />I know how to use certain exploits to inject custom code into existing programs internally, I understand hooks such as shadowVMT hooking to bypass
                            certain security measures that may be in place. I also know how to make my external code run in its own kernel driver in ring-0, so that usermode 
                            application are unable to detect any interactions my code makes. And in knowing this, I am also familiar with how to combat it.
                            
                            <br /><br />I have been coding for a vast majority of my life, I find the concept of creating something from nothing using only numbers and words to be incredibly
                            exciting. I pursued it as early as I could in highschool, and eventually went on to do it at college, recieving an A-Level. <br /><br /> If
